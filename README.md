# Usage
WARNING THESE IMAGES ARE VULNERABLE YOU WILL GET PWNED. Use at your own risk ;)

Just navigate to a folder and run `docker-compose up -d` to start. Each system exposes port 80 by default for Propane KoTH compatibility, modify at your leisure.

To kill use `docker-compose down` from the folder you started it from.

We just modified and organized them here for game purposes but all the hard work goes to those folks! ^
